# IMSC-HRM Test Suite

Tests are arranged into two categories, each in its own directory:

* each IMSC document in the [pass](./pass) directory conforms to the Hypothetical Render Model
* each IMSC document in the [fail](./fail) directory does not conform to the Hypothetical Render Model

Conformance is defined at <https://www.w3.org/TR/imsc-hrm/#conformance>

Each IMSC document contains a short description of the IMSC HRM feature being tested.

All IMSC documents conform to the [IMSC Text Profile](https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml-imsc1.2/#text-profile-constraints).
